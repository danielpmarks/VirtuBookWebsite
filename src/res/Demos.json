    "description": "This activity connects a classic harmonic oscillator example with inciteful information about the underlying physics. With graphs displaying instantanious potential and kinetic energy combined with real-time velocity and acceleration vectors, students can directly see the correlation of spring constant with energy and how dampening can effect effeciency."
